# Note: When a BitReader is instantiated, it must be given as argument
# a file object opened in binary reading mode ('rb'). When a BitWriter
# is instantiated, it must be given as argument a file object opened
# in binary writing mode ('wb').

# Code is based on http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Bitwise_IO#Python, with
# changes by Rolf Fagerberg.

# Bits are represented by ints, which in Python can be thougth of as
# infinite bitstrings of the form ...000001XXXXXXXXX (positive ints)
# or ...111110XXXXXXX (negative ints) or ......0000000 (zero). In the
# code below, some suffix (of length 8 or n) of the bitstring of an
# int constitutes the bits under consideration. The code is always
# passing from left to right in the bit sequences (i.e., both in the
# int suffix and in the file).

# For writing, note that when flush() is called, a full byte will be
# written to the file by right-filling the byte with 0's (because the
# accumulator is reset to 0 (= ......0000000) after each write). This
# is the intended functionality. If on the other hand flush() is not
# called after writing has finished, the last bits written (up to 7)
# may be lost.

# If a BitWriter is instantiated via a "with ... as ..." statement,
# flush() will automatically be called (via the __exit__() method).

# The method for checking for EOF while reading is by using
# readsucces() after each readbit(). Here is an example of use:
# 
#   while True:
#       x = bitstreamin.readbit()
#       if not bitstreamin.readsucces():  # End-of-file?
#           break
#       bitstreamout.writebit(x)
